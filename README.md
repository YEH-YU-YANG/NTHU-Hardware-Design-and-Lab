# NTHU-Hardware-Design-and-Lab

Prof : C.T Huang
Semester : 2023 fall

These are the code and reports for all the hardware design experiments in the lab.

## Lab 0 -  FPGA Tutorial and Test-Your-Own-FPGA Demo

* Going through the Vivado tutorial for FPGA implementation.
* Testing the Basys 3 FPGA board.

## Lab 1 - ALU Designs

* Getting familiar with basic Verilog behavior modeling

code  : 70/70
report: 28.95/30

## Lab 2 -  Parameterized Ping-Pong Counter

* Getting familiar with Verilog sequential behavior modeling.
* Practicing counter and FSM designs in Verilog.
* Practicing memory data structure in Verilo

code  : 70/70
report: 27.3/30

## Lab 3 - Clock Divider and LED Controller

* Getting familiar with the clock divider and LED control on the FPGA demo board.
  
code  : 70/70
report: 28.65/30

## Lab 4 - BCD Counters

* Getting familiar with the 7-segment display and pushbuttons on the FPGA board.
Note: Signals from pushbuttons should be processed by debouncing and one-pulse 
converters properly.
*  Getting familiar with the counter designs and finite-state machines in Verilog.

code  : 70/70
report: 24.45/30

## Lab 5 - Vending Machine

* Getting familiar with the modeling of finite state machines in Verilog.
* Getting familiar with the FPGA design flow and the keyboard control of the demo
board.
