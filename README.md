# NTHU-Hardware-Design-and-Lab

Prof : C.T Huang <br>
Semester : 2023 

This repository aims to store codes and reports for all hardware design and lab homeworks.

## Lab 0 -  FPGA Tutorial and Test-Your-Own-FPGA Demo

* Going through the Vivado tutorial for FPGA implementation.
* Testing the Basys 3 FPGA board.

## Lab 1 - ALU Designs

* Getting familiar with basic Verilog behavior modeling

* code  : 70/70 <br>
  report: 28.95/30

## Lab 2 -  Parameterized Ping-Pong Counter

* Getting familiar with Verilog sequential behavior modeling.
* Practicing counter and FSM designs in Verilog.
* Practicing memory data structure in Verilo

* code  : 70/70 <br>
  report: 27.3/30

## Lab 3 - Clock Divider and LED Controller

* Getting familiar with the clock divider and LED control on the FPGA demo board.
  
* code  : 70/70 <br>
  report: 28.65/30

## Lab 4 - BCD Counters

* Getting familiar with the 7-segment display and pushbuttons on the FPGA board.
Note: Signals from pushbuttons should be processed by debouncing and one-pulse 
converters properly.
*  Getting familiar with the counter designs and finite-state machines in Verilog.

* code  : 70/70 <br>
  report: 24.45/30

## Lab 5 - Vending Machine

board.

* code  : 70/70 <br>
  report: 27.9/30

## Lab 6: Digital Photo Frame and VGA Game

*  Getting familiar with the VGA display, block RAM, and other IOs on the FPGA demo
board.

* code  : 70/70 <br>
  report: 29.55/30

## Lab 7: Piano Helper
*  Getting familiar with the control of the audio peripheral Pmod I2S2.

* code  : 70/70 <br>
  report: 30/30

## Lab 8: Autonomous Kar
* Getting familiar with the Pmod connectors for external devices
* Getting familiar with the 3-way track sensor and ultrasonic sensor
* Learning to control typical DC motors via PWM signals

* code  : 70/70 <br>
  report: 28.43/30
